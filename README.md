In our ELECTENG/COMPSYS 209 course, we were put in a group of 4 and was tasked to design and create a smart energy monitor.

This project was based around analogue electronics & embedded software development. It exposed us to PCB design, firmware, serial communication, and the use of a microcontroller called ATmega328P.
The tools we used in this project were Microchip Studio, Altium Designer, LTspice, and Proteus VSM.

My role in the project varied from week to week as we all decided to work on a little bit of everything, ranging from circuit design or soldering to firmware coding. However we assigned specific areas to each other, e.g. In firmware coding, one was tasked to handle UART while another was tasked with the Timers.
The only thing I didn't get to do was design the PCB as it was not my role.
